# GroupProject 

A library site created with react as a group project for web-dev course. I worked mostly on the back-end, functionality and troubleshooting.

todo:

- overhaul backend to use browser cache to store login status and fix problems with some of the code. This will fix current problems with json-server crashes. (underconstruction)

- fix header redirect

- fix returnbook code
